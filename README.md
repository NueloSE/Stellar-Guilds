# Stellar Guilds

A decentralized guild and bounty platform on Stellar, where communities fund projects, distribute rewards, and automate payments through multi-contract workflows.

## Overview

Stellar Guilds is a decentralized platform for community-driven projects and collaborations. It allows individuals or organizations to create guilds, fund projects, and automatically distribute rewards using Stellar smart contracts (Soroban).

## Key Features

### 🏰 Guild Creation & Membership Contracts
- Users can create guilds (like DAOs) with multiple members
- Membership contracts define voting power, roles, and staking rules
- Decentralized governance for community-driven decisions

### 💰 Bounty & Task Contracts
- Guilds can post tasks or challenges with attached payment pools
- Smart contracts hold funds in escrow until completion criteria are met
- Transparent and automated task management

### 💸 Payment Distribution Contracts
- Payments are automatically split among contributors based on rules (percentage shares, milestones, or token staking)
- Supports multiple currencies: XLM or custom Stellar tokens
- Fair and automated reward distribution

### 🎯 Milestone & Subscription Contracts
- Projects with multiple phases release payments automatically upon milestone completion
- Recurring rewards for ongoing contributors
- Long-term project sustainability

### ⚖️ Dispute Resolution Contracts
- Optional arbitration module for conflicts between guilds and contributors
- Funds can be released based on voting outcomes
- Fair conflict resolution mechanisms

### ⭐ Reputation & Incentive Layer
- Contributors earn reputation tokens for successful task completion
- Higher reputation increases future payment rates or access to premium bounties
- Merit-based ecosystem growth

## Architecture

### Contract Layer
Each component of the platform is powered by Soroban smart contracts:
- **Guild Membership Contracts**: Manage members, roles, and governance
- **Bounty/Escrow Contracts**: Handle task creation and fund locking
- **Milestone Release Contracts**: Automate payment releases based on milestones
- **Payment Distribution Contracts**: Multi-party revenue sharing and staking
- **Dispute Resolution Contracts**: Optional arbitration and conflict management

### Payment System
- Supports one-off payments and recurring payouts
- Native XLM and custom Stellar token support
- Every task, milestone, or bounty involves real Stellar transactions

## Tech Stack

| Component | Technology |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Smart Contracts** | Soroban (Rust) |
| **Frontend** | React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS |
| **Blockchain** | Stellar Network |
| **Data Storage** | IPFS for metadata, Stellar ledger for transactions |
| **Authentication** | Wallet-based (Freighter or XUMM) |

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Rust**: Install from [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/)
- **Soroban CLI**: Install Stellar Soroban tools
  ```bash
  cargo install --locked soroban-cli
  ```
- **Node.js**: v18+ for frontend development
- **Stellar Wallet**: Freighter or XUMM for testing

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Stellar-Guilds.git
   cd Stellar-Guilds
   ```

2. **Set up smart contracts**
   ```bash
   cd contract
   cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release
   ```

3. **Set up frontend**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

### Development

#### Smart Contract Development
```bash
cd contract
cargo test
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release
```

#### Frontend Development
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

## Testing

### Contract Testing
```bash
cd contract
cargo test
```

### Integration Testing
```bash
# Run local Stellar network
soroban network start

# Deploy contracts
./scripts/deploy.sh

# Run tests
cargo test --features integration
```

## Deployment

### Testnet Deployment
```bash
soroban contract deploy \
  --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/contract.wasm \
  --source YOUR_SECRET_KEY \
  --network testnet
```

### Mainnet Deployment
```bash
soroban contract deploy \
  --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/contract.wasm \
  --source YOUR_SECRET_KEY \
  --network mainnet
```

## Use Cases

- **Open Source Communities**: Fund contributors for bug fixes and feature development
- **Creative Guilds**: Coordinate artists, writers, and creators with automated payments
- **Research DAOs**: Pool funds for research projects with milestone-based payouts
- **Freelance Collectives**: Manage multi-party projects with transparent payment splits
- **Gaming Guilds**: Distribute rewards and manage in-game economies
