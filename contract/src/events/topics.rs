/// Standardized event topic constants for all Stellar Guilds contract modules.
///
/// Topics are two-element tuples of `(module, action)` Symbols that Stellar's
/// event system uses for efficient filtering. All module code must use the
/// constants defined here instead of creating ad-hoc Symbol strings inline.
///
/// # Naming Convention
/// - Module constants: `MOD_<MODULE>` — identifies which sub-module fired the event.
/// - Action constants: `ACT_<ACTION>` — identifies what happened.
///
/// # Backward Compatibility
/// Symbol values in Soroban are limited to 32 bytes. Keep all strings short.
/// Once a symbol string is deployed and indexed by external tools, treat it as
/// immutable. If a rename is needed, bump EVENT_SCHEMA_VERSION and add a
/// migration note here.
///
/// # How to add a new module or action
/// 1. Add a `pub const MOD_<MODULE>: &str` entry below.
/// 2. Add `pub const ACT_<ACTION>: &str` entries for its actions.
/// 3. Update `emit.rs` if the new module needs special envelope handling.
/// 4. Document the new event in the module's `//! Events` section.
